Example of SignalR 1.1.1 with F-Sharp and Silverlight 5:

- SignalR is a library on top of WebSockets, which is HTML5 API that 
  enables bi-directional communication between the browser and server.
  SignalR will fallback to other techniques and technologies 
  when WebSockets are not available.

- F-Sharp (F#) is multiparadigm (functional-first) programming language 
  mainly for .NET environment.
  http://fsharp.org/
  
- This sample uses Reactive Extensions 2.1 to communicate with SignalR, 
  on both client and server side. Reactive Extensions is a library to 
  compose asynchronous and event-based programs using observable 
  collections and LINQ-style query operators.

- For server side:  
  This could work purely from F# as Owin (Windows Console Application) 
  but now server has been called from empty ASP.NET C# Web Application.

- For Client side:
  Silverlight 5.0 application using F#-library
  and Silverlight 5.0 XAML/C# application to show the user interface.

- This proof of concept/sample/tutorial/demo is developed with 
  Visual Studio 2012. References are resolved via NuGet. 
  F# compiler won't auto-restore packages on compile. 
  So go first to Tools -> Library Package Manager -> NuGet
  and press "Restore" to restore all the references.
