{"name":"SignalR-FSharp-Example","tagline":"Example of Signal-R 2.0 with FSharp (F# server side and both Silverlight 5 (F#) and Javascript clients) and Rx","body":"**Example of SignalR with F-Sharp (and Silverlight 5 or Javascript):**\r\n\r\n- SignalR is a library (for web-based Publish/Subscribe -pattern) on top \r\n  of WebSockets, which is HTML5 API that enables bi-directional communication \r\n  between the browser and server. SignalR will fallback to other techniques and \r\n  technologies when WebSockets are not available.\r\n  [http://signalr.net/][1]\r\n  \r\n- F-Sharp (F#) is multiparadigm (functional-first) programming language \r\n  mainly for .NET environment.\r\n  [http://fsharp.org/][2]\r\n  \r\n- This sample uses Reactive Extensions 2.1 to communicate with SignalR, \r\n  on both client and server side. Reactive Extensions is a library to \r\n  compose asynchronous and event-based programs using observable \r\n  collections and LINQ-style query operators.\r\n  [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/gg577609.aspx][3]\r\n\r\n- For server side:  \r\n  This could work purely from F# as Owin ([http://owin.org/][4]) console application \r\n  but now F#-server-side is called from an empty ASP.NET C# Web Application. \r\n  (You can start OWin from F# Interactive...)\r\n\r\n- For client side:\r\n  Silverlight 5.0 application using F#-library\r\n  and Silverlight 5.0 XAML/C# application to show the user interface.\r\n  [http://www.silverlight.net][5]\r\n  There is also jQuery/JavaScript test page, if you don't want to use Silverlight.\r\n  \r\n- This proof of concept/sample/tutorial/demo is developed with \r\n  Visual Studio 2012. References are resolved via NuGet. \r\n  F# compiler won't auto-restore packages on compile. \r\n  **So go first to Tools -> Library Package Manager -> NuGet\r\n  and press \"Restore\" to restore all the references, and then rebuild.**\r\n\r\n- SignalR supports two kinds of connections: Hub and PersistentConnection\r\n  Both are working with Silverlight and JavaScript. \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://signalr.net/\r\n  [2]: http://fsharp.org/\r\n  [3]: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/gg577609.aspx\r\n  [4]: http://owin.org/\r\n  [5]: http://www.silverlight.net\r\n","google":"UA-46088957-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
